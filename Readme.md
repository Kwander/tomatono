Tomatono
=============

A console-based Pomodoro application for Ubuntu.
Written in Ruby. Google 'Pomodoro' to get a grasp of this productivity enhancing technique.

The market is flooded with Pomodoro apps. The idea is to develop
a minimalistic client that would not be distracting.

I just want to make people more productive. That's it.
